# SpringBootHelloWorld
Spring Boot gradle version project



The Spring Boot gradle plugin provides many convenient features:

	- It collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single, runnable "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and
	  transport your service.
	  
	- It searches for the public static void main() method to flag as a runnable class.
	
	- It provides a built-in dependency resolver that sets the version number to match Spring Boot dependencies. You can override any
	  version you wish, but it will default to Boot’s chosen set of versions.
